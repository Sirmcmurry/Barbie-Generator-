I said I'm cool on it, baby, yeah, I'm straight
He say his love, I don't it want it, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
You do too much, too little, yeah, too late

Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, too little, yeah, too late
Boy, you're too much, I'm cool on it, I'm straight

You shoulda been listenin', listenin' in
Too busy glistenin', glistenin' in
Why you ain't listen then, listen back then?
Now you're too much, too little, yeah, too late

Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was o' six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I look down, yes I suppose

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
(And we know, we know) say f*ck the world, we ridin' until the end
I know it's sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it all for you

I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said, he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know, that I love him
Family ties, broken before me, niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

I feel a minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment till it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
(And we know, we know) say f*ck the world, we ridin' until the end
I know it's sudden, look at what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it all for you

Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I'm love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact
I'd give it all, if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say "We did it!"
My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Jee we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is the Pinkprint

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'mma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mill' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man, you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em f*ck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'mma ask on the song

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And you know how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the f*ck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the f*ck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked, all along
I'mma ask on the song

So does she know I've been in that bed before?
A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

Do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

But if he can't f*ck three times a night, peace
I tried to f*ck 50 for a powerful hour
All the nigga wanna do is talk power for hours

When it come to stealin' flows these birds is fluent

Barbie tingz, there's Barbie tingz
Big Barbie tingz, there's Barbie tingz
Big Barbie tingz, there's Barbie tingz
Barbie dream house, Barbie rings
There's Barbie beach house, Barbie Benz
Barbie white picket, Barbie fence
All tea, all shade, bitch, all offense
If you ever try to confiscate Barbie's Ken

Chop it up and the next stop garbage bin
'Cause you hoes too old to be gossipin'
I'm just tryna find out when the new Porsche come in

Baby you my everything
You're all I ever wonted
We can do it real big
Bigger then you ever done it
You be up on everything
The other hoes ain't never on it

I can spent whatever on it
'Cause she holds me down
Every time I hit her up
When I get it right I promise we gonna live it up
She makes me beg for it til' she gives it up
Then I say the same thing every single time I say

[Chorus]
You the fucking best 
You the fucking best

And you know I be over there

Shawty I be over there

You didn't even know was there

You don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart
Or we can share it
Like the last slice
Always felt that you
So a custom to the fast life
Having a nigga thinking
That he met you in the past life
Sweat pants, hair tie,
Chilling with no make on
That's when your the prettiest
I hope you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip
When friends say
You ain't bringing drake along
You know that
I been working I be there
Soon as I make it hooome
And she patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to
The roomers and what they assumed
And till them girls proofed it
I'm the one to never get confused with

Baby you my everything
You're all I ever wonted
We can do it real big
Bigger then you ever done it
You be up on everything
The other hoes ain't never on it

Then I say the same thing every single time I say

[Chorus]

Ayo you're the only one
That see the real Nicki
I can show you chill Nicki
'Cause of how you deal with me
And they knock my blocks down
You come and you build with me
Even though you real busy
He's the fucking real drizzy
It's so amazing, I figure out
This world is ours for the taking
I figure out that when I go out
And those people scream
That some of theme are living vicariously threw me
That's why I put that "s" on my chest
And I'm gone but on a other note
Let's have sexs in my dorm
And I'm a make you beg
Causing you look pretty when you begging
So meet me at the campus
I be there around 11
So let me put my books down
Excuse me if I look down
Guess I'm a little nervous
When I'm at your service
Look at what you took downnnnnnnnnnn

Baby you my everything
You all I ever wanted
We can do it real big
Bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything
Other niggas never on it
I want this forever
I swear I could spent whatever on it
'Cause I could hold you down
Every time you hit me up
When I get right around it
Tell me we gonna live it up
I make you beg for it
Until I give it up
You say the same thing
Every single time

[Chorus]

Sex love pain baby I be on that tank shit.
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc.
When my album drop bitches will buy it for the picture
And niggas will buy it to and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper girl but money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee
'Cause I be so official
Ma shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make ya pussy whistlee
Like the Andy Griffith theme song,
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love
You the one I lean on,
Feelin' for a fix then you should really get ya fiend on
Yea just kno ma condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back
And make ya fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in ya slot until the nigga hit the jackpot [I'm sayin']

Baby you ma everythin, you all I eva wanted
We can do it real big
Bigga den you eva done it
You be up on everythin'
Other hoes ain't eva on it
I want this foreva I swear I can spend wateva on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon' live it up
She make me beg for it till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

[Chorus]

Fall off in the spot
All you niggas do is run your jaw (Metro!)
Pull up with no top
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Fall off in the spot, every girl coming like a shark
Hanging on my necklace, this ain't no ski resort
Fall off in the spot, every girl coming like a shark
Put that thing in park, I'ma let my fit pick you apart
Glowing in the dark, pretty young girls on board
Running with the marksmen, everything on point like, "En garde"

Yo I'm me, I'm Barbie drippin', DB9, Barbie whippin'
If he say he don't want me back, he be lyin'
Bitch I'm the sauce, Barbie dippin', I'm the boss, Barbie sippin'
They keep tellin' work it, I ain't got no choice
I'm all yours, Barbie kissin', call the stores, Barbie shippin'
Out or indoors, baby I'ma floss
Wet, why of course, Barbie tippin', I endorse, Barbie strippin'
Mink carpet, but I ain't got no flaws
Doors look like rings, Barbie sittin', bad-da-bing, Barbie trippin'
Curve niggas like they arms in a sling
Hot off the swing, Barbie swingin', to the ring, Barbie blingin'
Good box, so he called Don a King
Who the f*ck gon' party with them dollies
No I never do them mollys, if I hit you then you probably gon' sew
Who the f*ck gon' come through with the body
Always thinkin' like a hottie, always saying what someone won't do
Who the f*ck gonna pull up in your city
Looking every bit pretty, with the itty bitty titty bitch crew
Who the f*ck gon' beat him with a 22
If he don't lose the attitude, and run off with his credit cards too

Fall off in the spot, every girl coming like a shark
Hanging on my necklace, this ain't no ski resort
Fall off in the spot, every girl coming like a shark
Put that thing in park, I'ma let my fit pick you apart
Glowing in the dark, pretty young girls on board
Running with the marksmen, everything on point like, "En garde"

Thousand dollar massage
I don't ever miss my mark
Anything I like goes in the cart
I might spend it all to prove a point
Rolling west coast, Arnold Schwarz
If she lick her lips then I'ma join
Indo I'ma spark
When I cash out that's her favorite part

They deliver my Lambo', all white with a tan bow
My body is a work of art, he eatin' this Van Gogh
I'm not in the bando, I'm Pablo Sandals
White beaches, candles, we sexin', anglo
Wh-wh-what you think all the niggas wanna cuff for?
A lot of Bloods, what you think they in the cut for?
Yeah it's the sweep, I ain't talkin' when the dust fall
My winnin' streak still hasn't peaked, you little dust ball
Bitch I'm a star-ar, me and Swae Lee, yah, yah

Everytime I score she gon' hear them swishes, ah
Tell that bitch I'm in the league, she still play for Wichita

The swish, swish God? Yup the swish God?

Fall off in the spot, every girl coming like a shark
Hanging on my necklace, this ain't no ski resort
Fall off in the spot, every girl coming like a shark
Put that thing in park, I'ma let my fit pick you apart
Glowing in the dark, pretty young girls on board
Running with the marksmen, everything on point like, "En garde"

But gang gang got the hammer and the wrench

Box seats bitch, f*ck the gossip

Maybe you died 'cause everybody ask me where you at
I try to channel you in hopes that I could stare you back
But its like every intersection we just missed each otha'
You got your fans waitin' tell me you ain't six feet unda'
And tell me that you coming back that you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake
In hindsight I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge
Your earrings bamboo, your long nails too
Your B.M.W. every time you came through
You was the braveheart
You stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up
You played the same part
But I needed to grow
And I needed to know
That there were some things inside of me that I need to show
So I just deaded you
Left you in all black
But dear old Nicki
Please call back

You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly I believed you
But I'm standing here calling I cant see you
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that

Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamor
Money, fame and power
'Cause if so that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me gettin' at them nameless cowards
There was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground, and I was mainstream
I live the life now, that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came yea, tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was on some stupid shit
But its still f*ck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you
Left you in all black
But dear old Nicki
Please call back

You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly I believe you
But I'm standing here calling I cant see you
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that

And yes I'm holdin you, holdin' you, holdin' you
Oh yes I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you

I live with the mother fuckin' pools and the trees is
Broke bitches so crusty (disgust me)
Gave the bitch a ride got the Continental dusty
Trust me I keep a couple hundred in the duff' b
Couple wet wipes in case a bum try to touch me
I'm the terminator, bitch talk slick I am have to terminate her
These little nappy headed hoes need a perminator
You my seed I spray you with the germinator
Move back bugs, matter fact you know the queen could use a back rub
If you could turn back time, Cher
You used the be here but now you gone Nair

Shitted on 'em,
Man I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em,
Put yo' number two's in the air if you did it on 'em
Shitted on 'em,
Man I just shitted on 'em
Shitted on 'em,
Put your number two's in the air if you did it on 'em

[Chorus]
Envy
All they do is envy
Don't they know what's in me?
Don't they know I'm comin' back, swingin' for that envy
Why would they offend me?
Why they go against me?
Don't they know I'm comin' back, swingin' for that ass
Sw-swingin' for, Sw-sw-sw-swingin' for
Sw-swingin' for, sw-sw-sw-swingin' for
Mercy, mercy, mercy
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me
Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty
Why they wanna curse me, curse me, curse me

Now every club promoter wanna bid like auctions
'Cause I pack shows, sell tics like Boston
Pat your back ho, why the f*ck they coughin'?
Oh, I got 'em sick, better get that coffin
I say coffin', you can say casket
They're so trash, where's the waste basket?
Where's my hat and where's my strait jacket?
Yup, they jackin', back to Maybachin'
Everything I do, bitches wanna do it too
I guess-guess you just skip to my lou
I just came through, I flew to St. Lou
Back to kill you, they blew like HQ
Why is it that they make Nicki a target?
Just 'cus this lil piggy went to the market
Marketing steps, they marketed sex
M-Mark it with a X, they talkin' them checks now

[Chorus]

Why did envy?
Why you go against me?
When I got trendy, why you ain't commend me?
Why when I needed it, why you couldn't lend me?
Why you was secretive, frontin' like you friendly?
Why did you fear that? Held my career back
Kick it like Air Max, I don't wanna hear that
'Cause now I see-see-see-see all your run-down
Niggas better have my money by sun down
'Cause now when I come through I'm stylin' on 'em
It's like I got hotter than islands on 'em
They say she got colder than igloos; Did she?
I'm in a GT, she in a Mitsubishi
Just left Mr. Miyagi
Tell that bitch jump if that bitch feel froggy
'Cause I got one leg up in the middle of the ring
And that bitch better duck when that bell go ding

[Chorus]

I'm me, don't you like what you see
Won't you get like me
'Cause you thought that I would die
But I'm fine
( Repeat )

It's fuckin' TR3YWAY!
It's King of New York, lookin' for the Queen
Uh, you got the right one, mm
L-let these-l-let these b-b-bitches know, nigga
Queens, Brooklyn, brr, ah!
Murda on the beat so it's not nice!

Pussy got that wet, wet, got that drip, drip
Got that Super Soaker, hit that, she a Fefe
Her name Keke, she eat my dick like it's free, free
I don't even know like "Why I did that?"
I don't even know like "Why I hit that?"
All I know is that I just can't wife that
Talk to her nice so she won't fight back
Turn around and hit it from the back, back, back
Bend her down then I make it clap, clap, clap

I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

Draco got that kick-back, when I blow that, they all do track
They don't shoot back, one shot, close range, red dot
Head tight, yeah, I did that, yeah, I live that
Call a Uber with my shooter, with a Ruger, we gon' do ya
Niggas say they killin' people, but I really fuckin' do it

I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

He-he tryna 69 like Tekashi, call him papi
Word to A$AP, keep me Rocky, I'm from New York, so I'm cocky
Say he fuckin' with my posse, copped me Chloé like Kardashi'
Keep this pussy in Versace, said I'm pretty like Tinashe
Put-put it all up in his face, did I catch a case?
Pussy game just caught a body, but I never leave a trace
Face is pretty, ass for days, I get chips, I ask for Lay's
I just sit back and when he done, I be like, "Yo, how'd it taste?"
(Yo, how'd it taste?)

I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

Ayo, Draco got that kick-back
When it kick-back, you can't get yo shit back
In fact this that bitch that
"I hate small talk, I don't f*ck with chit-chat"
AC just stopped workin'
So they hit me, told me bring my wrist back
Come through rockin' fashions
That got all these bitches like "Yo, what's that?"

I don't really want no friends
I don't really want no friends, no

Eeny, meeny, miny, moe
I catch a hoe right by her toe
If she ain't fuckin' me and Nicki
Kick that ho right through the door (TR3YWAY)
I don't really want no friends, my old ho just bought this Benz
Nicki just hopped in this shit, now I won't see that bitch again
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe (no)
I catch a ho right by her toe (no)
If she ain't fuckin' me and Nicki (no)
Kick that ho right through the door (no, TR3YWAY)

Mmm, Young Money, Young Money bunny
Colorful hair, don't care
I don't really want no friends, I don't really want no friends, no
I don't really want no friends, I don't really want no friends, no
Scum Gang!

Ayo, as the world turns, the blunt burns
(Who you gettin' at, Nicki?)
Watch them cunts learn
Fashion icon, Audrey Hepburn
I move keys, but you hoes get one turn
Yeah, you get one turn, and one urn
I straighten all these bitches out with one perm
Who ever gassed 'em ain't none of my concern
But, see, the Lord showed me dreams to confirm
They done went to witch doctors to bury the Barbie
But I double back, kill bitches, bury the body
And that go for anybody, you'll be thoroughly sorry
I could wage war or I come in peace like Gandhi
All my powers back now I'm scary to zombies
Bring the heat to her, sizzle 'em, ain't talking Kalonji
I done fasted and prayed, had to cleanse my body
Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body
I ain't giving, so don't ask, I don't lend my body
Gotta be king status to give a man my body
(He gotta be king status to get in ya body?)
F*ck, yeah, 'cause a queen is what I embody, uh

Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn

Yo, you can't wear Nicki wig and then be Nicki
That's like a fat nigga thinkin' he can be Biggie
One rough ride, now you DMX and Swissy
One hot video, you hyped? Now you just giddy
You made one dope beat, now you Kanye?
You got a nigga named Jay, now you 'Yoncé?
You got about three stacks, now you André?
You put a part in your fade, oh, you Nas, bae?
You gotta have real skill, gotta work for that
If it's really your passion would you give the world for that?
Unlike a lot of these hoes whether wack or lit
At least I can say I wrote every rap I spit
Put my blood, sweat and tears in perfecting my craft
Still every team's number one pick in the draft
You could bring anybody, weatherman, pick a day
I'm Kobe, KD, Kyrie! Pick a K

Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn (Mmm)
Ganja burn, ganja burn, ganja burn
Everytime I get high, I just think about you
Everytime I get high, I just think about you

Hold on baby

I just wanna be your diamond, babe
Guaranteed to be a problem

You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe, ah yeah

Yo, I just wanna be ya rider
You should pull up in that Spyder
You should let me hit the mic
And I ain't talking about the fighter
Get it lit without a lighter
Let's pull an all-nighter
Tell me-tell me what you need, got the weed
I'm a bad little bitch and I never indict her
Get locked, I'mma write ya
You on the road? I'mma Skype ya
I don't wanna hype ya
But you a lucky nigga if my mean ass like ya
You ain't never have a bitch understand you
Most of them wanna use you when they ran through
I just wanna be somebody that can add to
Your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too
I just wanna listen
When you leave I say "damn, I fucking miss him"
I just wanna be your vixen
Give you something real wet to put your lips in
I wanna be the only one that can check you
And still respect you

Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
Won't you let me be your favorite?

Ayo, I just wanna be your first go to
Do you like a real one supposed to, livin' bi-coastal
Scoop me in the truck, late night, on a humble
Meet me out in Queens where the city want a sundown
You could put your gun down, you could have fun now
You could tell you niggas that you won now, one down
Run through the clubs with the baddest
Bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters
And they say Birkin where the bag is
Gotta lot of bags, but we never got baggage
Winter Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance
I'mma have you coming in my palace
London, Tokyo, Paris
Let me update your status

'Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
Won't you let me be your favorite?

You should already know

I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

Uh yo, yo,
I wish today it will rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become Neo when they aiming at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just surmising
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more fire

I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

Uh yo, yo
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocating every time it locks me in
Paintin' they own pictures than they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
So we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfucking time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nay's become yay's
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's

I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it

I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

Against me will prosper and I truly
Believe that my haters are my motivators.
Young Money.

[Chorus]

If you could you would get rid of me, 
F*** you gone do when a b**** try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne.
I done put the choke hold on now 
They screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I'm Still the one to beat.
Ain't in a rush from these streets
I am the streets. I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard

Carter called, lemme get the car key, you don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquis, everything sparkly (man man down! ) hit em on a walkie-talkie.
Hit em, hit em knock-knock, tell em let me in. my name ring bells b**** buzz me in
And I only stop for pedestrians, or real real bad lesbian.
Hit em wit the Mac, hit em wit the Tech 9, hit em wit the Ruger by the intersex sine. hit em wit a Tommy so my n****s call me Pammy and I always the jammy in the trunk or in the lamby
Put my whole burrough on my back and I'm gooda, I don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up, used to drink water wit a little bit of sugar.
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups, doin' the scissor-leg on the mat wit my foot up.
Young black pin-up, all of my b****es did up, now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up.
And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner, b****es like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma
These birds all fly south in the winter, f*** I look like chompin' on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle; I'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, Louis on the duffel. I'm a bad b**** no muzzle. (no muzzle).
B****es is softer than Al Dante, cut from a different kentae. tell em I'm the ninja, 
Weezy is my sensei. so I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter. gimme my chopsticks
I'll have the rap b****es for dinner.
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis
This is for my n**** 7-up in Castaki
This is for my n****s wheeling them Kawasakis
Shout out to the back east salt fish eggs
Kisses is to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda c***y.
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky.
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinski.
Pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed.
Write my own raps I gotta go, I gotta get me (gotta get me.)
Oh

[Chorus]

If you could you would get rid of me, 
F*** you gone do when a b**** try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne.
I done put the choke on now 
They screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I will, I gots to win.
I'm still lookin' around for my
Competition, I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard 

From slap-and-cry you start to die, so I must go harder.
Gotta make these b****es know me just like Bobby know water.
Better yet, like Bubba, know shrimp. but he don't say s***
When the gun on his lip, and I don't say s*** put the gun
On my hip. so I don't say s*** but the gun on my hip.
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship
Check out how them b****es just run on my dick
And me, I'm that nasty son of a b****.
I still got that b**** cum on my lips
It yee ain got money, don't come on my strip
And if ya got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic, but I can still
Make you tumble and flip
You f***in' wit me if you f***in' wit Nick
They ain't f***in' wit me ,they ain't f***in' wit Nick
Your girlfriend and she just split
'cause she wanna f*** me and she wanna f*** Nick
They wonder if he be f***in' Nick, as long as she be f***in' rich
That's why I keep my luggage 'cause, I swear y'all's a f***in' trip.
Young Money Dungeon, b****. my swagger is just punching b****
And I shoot like I'm from over-seas, so call my gun, "Gunovich"
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" is for a bunch of s***
Red drank, blue pill, white dust
Yes I love my country b****.

[Chorus]

Wish you could get rid of Young Money, 
F*** you gone do when a b**** try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne.
I done put the choke on now 
They screamin', "Nicki leave me alone!"
I am, I will, I gots to win.
I'm still lookin' around for my
Competition, I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go, go, go, go hard

Eardrummers
Uh, uh, huh, uh, huh
Uh, yo, hold up, hold up
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Yo hold up, hold up, hold up, okay, hold up
You see a bad bitch coming, tell yo ass to hold up
I'm in that new new meeting Nunu when I roll up
I told the valet, "Park the Benz and bring the Rolls up"
Yo hold up, hold up, hold up, okay, hold up
He see me lookin' pretty every time he scroll up
Might gotta let the blicky hit you if you stroll up
Now put your hands up, it's a hold up
Run me the money

'Cause I be the baddie B, Barbie Tingz
Banging body B, everybody be on my D
Yo I gotta be in reality, suck a D if you doubted me
Back of the back, back of the back
Back of the back, back of the back
Who on Barbie D? Who on Barbie D? Everybody
Who you gotta see? Honestly, on my odyssey
I'm the baddest B, I don't even know how to speak
Hat to the hat to the back and relax, you in the back of the 'Bach

See a bitch got more coins than a game room
So we ain't ever hatin' in TheShadeRoom
See I keep my sons in a playroom
So me and you ain't ever in the same room

I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don't ever cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin' push for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he bite, he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin' up I'm in a good foreign
I be like ooh he love me, ooh he love me, good form
Come on, come on, come on
I be like ooh he love me, ooh he love me, good form (come on)

I slick, slick drop the top like nip slips
So he tryna smash like when the whip flips
I hit licks just to floss with this wrist
And when I leave my bitches we all say, "Kiss kiss"
I'm in that new new De Larenta, tryna land Bugs Bunny
'Cause all I want is karats and some big drug money
I'm only loyal to the niggas that'll bust guns for me
The jig up, it's a stick up
Run me the money

'Cause I be the baddie B, Barbie Tingz
Bangin' body B, everybody be on my D
Yo I gotta be in reality, suck a D if you doubted me
Back of the back, back of the back
Back of the back, back of the back
Who on Barbie D? Who on Barbie D? Everybody
Who you gotta see? Honestly, on my odyssey
I'm the baddest B, I don't even know how to speak
Hat to the hat to the back and relax, you in the back of the 'Bach

See a bitch get more press than a key pad
Before you suck me off, get a knee pad
See I pull the strings like a tea bag
I'm prolly with my jeweler playin' freeze tag

I tell him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he eat the cookie he got good form
He know I don't ever cheat because I'm good to him
Might gotta have his baby, nurses yellin' push for him
You see I let him eat the cookie 'cause it's good for him
And when he bite, he eat the cookie he got good form
He know that when I'm pullin' up I'm in a good foreign
I be like ooh he love me, ooh he love me, good form
Come on, come on, come on
I be like ooh he love me, ooh he love me, good form
Come on

Am I just a fool?
Blind and stupid for loving you
Am I just a silly girl?
So young and naive to think you were
The one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold hearted shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark

And now the people are talking
The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
Like a grand piano
The people are talking
The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
Like a grand piano

So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on

Am I being a fool?
Wrapped up in lies and foolish truths
What do I see in you?
Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do
'Cause I keep thinking you were
The one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold hearted shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark
The people are talking
The people are saying that you have been playing my heart

Why is it that u can see the worst in me
I swear sometimes it feels like it natures me
But to keep it all real is kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'm a just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mer-ce-des
And I might pop a couple of them per-ca-ces
Yeah that'll make me transform to Hercules

Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am
Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am
Here I am, here I am, so tell me, cause I am

(I love who I am, I love, whoa)

I swear to God, man, everything in life is old
And the only thing that change is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife I'm a fight your soul
'Cause the second time around I'll be twice as bold
So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold till death do us part
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe
Then you say I won't survive if I leave
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve
I no longer need your attention, at ease

It's a joke, it's a game,
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar

It's a joke, it's a game,
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed

Here I am, here I am, so take me, as I am

He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love fucking with them heart breakers
But he was getting money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, bald like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to sing-sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
5-year bid up North when they ratted
Anyway I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat-belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never f*ck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers, I'm in the zone

They holler at me, but it's you, you, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want, whip it whenever you want
Baby it's yours 
Anywhere, everywhere, baby it's your world, ain't it? (alright)
Baby it's your world, ain't it?

Uh, she got a nigga at home and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her "make me some money", she tell me "make me a wife"
I tell that bitch "you crazy, f*ck wrong with you?"
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hitting
And I say "what about them niggas?" She say: "what about them niggas?"
You right, what you doing tonight? 
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I'd get life
She love me like a brother, but f*ck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'mma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her "stop lying, mine and who else?"
She say worry about yourself Lil Tune

They holler at me, but it's you, you, this ain't high school
Me and my crew, we can slide through
Give it to you whenever you want, whip it whenever you want
Baby it's yours 
Anywhere, everywhere, baby it's your world, ain't it? 
Baby it's your world, ain't it?

I know you want it boy, I see you tryin'
Just keep on pushing, I'mma let you slide in
Just close your eyes and, this horizon
It's ready, come get you some
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You could never understand why I grind like I do
Mikiyah and Gulani while I grind like I do
'C-c-cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was cracked
Now the whole album crack you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend, as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls, that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin you told 'em it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breath, tell that motherfucker say so

Even though I said I didn’t love you
I lied, I lied
Even though I said I didn’t need you
I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

Even though I said don’t touch me
I lied, I lied
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
Can’t let you think that Imma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said let’s see
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fucking proof
'Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose
You just a heart breaker won’t let you break mine
'Cause I’ll be smashing windows and cutting them break lines

I lied
'Cause who knew that if I just let myself go with you
Who knows, who knows, so I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

Even though I said 'f*ck you'
I lied, I lied

I thought eventually you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss miss the d o
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real it was magic
If it was a record it would have been classic
But f*ck you though, orgasmic

I guess this is what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth, who knew what you’d
Do if I let you in
My mama ain't raised no fool, I
I am not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Falling so fast I am afraid of you, so I lied

I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh oh
I lied
Ooh baby
Ooh

It's like I get chills down my spine when I'm near him
Mad I'm a tad too bad, I don't fear 'em
I don't need the preachers, I'm the high priestess
Everywhere I go I get "Hi nice to meet you"
Bitches know I be stiff, I'm the fashionista
And they know I stay around the white like a groom
Look up in the sky I see somebody on a broom
I think I'm gettin' ha-high, ha-high on my own supply
Yellin RASTA-FARI when I'm ridin' by
See I used to be the wife of a king
Back when I was smugglin' them things in the bing
Now that I'm a boss bitch, it's a win-win
Come to Mr. Chow's or meet me in Chin-Chin
Now I get cha-ching and my name bells ring
Oops I mean my name ring bells, ding ding

I'm in Jamaica with them keys under palm trees

Blasphemy, my niggas will blast for me
All these low IQ hoes baffle me
Tell 'em that I watch but just take a bath for me
Put the trophies in my crib like a athlete
I see them give me fake love but that trash is weak
Man, you know that I rip every rap and beat
You know Nicki gon' eat, Bon Apetit

So time we spend is borrowed
It's our moment, right here, f*ck tomorrow
'Cause moments like these are to die for
And she's clear all
Nice and easy as hair, when I'm bleaching it blonde
So we got that lightning in a bottle

She's tipsy, I'm sober
So she gets a chip on her shoulder
Sits on the sofa, I go to load a
Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on
She goes, "All that old school hip-hop is so fucked
Think that shit's got pneumonia"
I told her, "Bitch now, just hold up"
That's why rap needs a doctor
Our genre's lymph nodes are swole up
It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis
'Cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts
That's why Tribe is so vital, we need Q-Tip for the culture

Speed it up a little bit
You ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight
I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache
And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake
I wanna accelerate to a level that I can elevate
Demented with the pen, I'll make the motherfucker detonate
I wanna make it acapella, wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we renovate
And re-develop hella weights, and I'ma get a special place, now
Take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
Right in the behind, I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these heights, they're just too high to reach it
I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat
'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek
Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?
Even if you're fire-breathe, ain't shit you can say to inspire heat
If you wrapped your entire meat pad up in a dryer sheet
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of f*ck it
Better not use me as your topic, anybody who brings me, duck it
Let me keep it one hundred, two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion
The queen and her husband, last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah

Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (oh, oh)
Whatever you want, you can have from me (oh, oh)
I want your love, just lead me on
Won’t give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey

You settle for lesst yo, you disrespect fo'
You is bad show, the new you just dough
So cut all that bull, the nerve of me to come up my pedestal
Come off my pedestal, money off that at a boat
Which means that back stacked high
You ain't get the drive money get your pedal stalled
You said you wept, everyday a queen you slept on
And I ain't talkin' 'but your mattresses 
But um you're the type of player I pressed eject on
I can't believe you played for that long
I never re-respected for nobody
I never needed you, you must have thought I did
I should have copped the stick but I'm Teflon
Pressed on, head's strong, sex the bomb
Dreams of a bad bitch tryna F a don
If it's word bond, any one I sex, icons
If we bust down, I don't wanna waste my time
Who the f*ck you thought you were, you tryna stunt on Nick'?
Should have put you on blast like a gun whitehead
But it's okay, we gon' keep secrets nigga
'Cause a true bad bitch ain't weak or bitter

Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
All my life, man, f*ck's sake
If I did I did a menage with 'em
And let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a set up for a punchline on duct tape
Worried bout if my butt's fake
Worried 'bout John's singing us Drake
These girls are my sons, John and Kate plus eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a f*ck if I was late
Dealing with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut one, hut two, big titties, big butt too
F*ck with them real niggas who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me even if their name was pop quiz
Bad bitches who I f*ck with, mad bitches we don't f*ck with
I don't f*ck with them chickens unless they last name is cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasonin'
And tell 'em, tell 'em blow me, Lance Stephenson

Raise your bottle and cup in the sky

All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Holly Groove, the holy Mecca
Accountant say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girl from a Bida if she wave
Baby and I fucked with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? I take mothers instead
You got the hickups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp boy, treat me like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with arm and guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two goons and they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms

Now you see me, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx, acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with 17 bullets
My story is how I went from poor me
To police pour me a drink and celebrate with me

Raise your bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight

Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only

How do you
How do you

You let me win,
You let me ride
You let me rock
You let me slide
And when they lookin'
You let me hide.
Defend my honor
Protect my pride.
The good advice
I always hated
But looking back
It made me greater.
You always told me
Forget the haters
Just get my money,
Just get my weight up.
Know when I'm lying,
Know when I'm crying
It's like you got it
Down to a science
Why am I trying
No you ain't buying,
I tried to fight it
Back with defiance.
You make me laugh
You make me hoarse
From yelling at you
And getting at you
Picking up dishes
Throwing them at you.
Why are you speaking
When no one asked you.

You see right through me.
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you

You see right through me.
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you

What are we doing,
Could you see through me?
Cause you say Nicki
And I say who me?
And you say no you
And I say screw you.
Then you start dressing
And you start leaving
And I start crying
And I start screaming
The heavy breathing
But whats the reason.
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually fronting
I'm askin' you something
Yo, answer this question,
Class is in session,
Tired of letting
Passive aggression
Control my mind,
Capture my soul
OK your right
Just let it go.
OK you got it,
Its in the can.
Before I played it
You knew my hand.
You could turn a free throw into a goal.
Nigga got the peep hole to my soul.

You see right through me.
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you

You see right through me.
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you

Stop,
Stop,
Would you just stop looking through me
Cause I just cant take it.
No I cant take it.

You see right through me.
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you do that shit
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you
How do you

You see right through me.
(you see right through me baby)
You see right through me
You see right through me

I am not Jasmine, I'm Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So f*ck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flat screen
(Haha) Plasma
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that hoe, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

I ain't into S and M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off,
and I still wouldn't f*ck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off,
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off
Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollerin' 'Why, God?'
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones,
so won't be finished swallowin' my wad
I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch
Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealin' my music,
so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not)

The wo-world is my punchin' bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic

(I-I-I-I-Is)
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
(Ni-ni-ni) "Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I-I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a stand, still, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
(Manning, Eli!) Ma, ma-ma-ma-ma, Manning, Eli
These bitches callin' me (Manning, Eli)

A-a-a-a-all you lil' fagots can suck it
No homo', but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if
You have the same passion that I have
Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass
You ass dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!)
Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's (high class) meets (white trash)

Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Roman!
Roman!
Stop it, stop it!
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What's goin' on?
They'll lock you away!
They'll put you in a jail cell!
I promise!
Take your mother's warning, Roman
Please!
Back to bed!
Run along!
Let's go!
Come on!
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys
(Boys, boys, boys, boys, boys, boys)

Don't be goofy, bring some passion to the table, what you doin'?
Don't be stupid, I'm the realest bitch you know, yeah, I'm the truest
When you pull up, gotta pull up on me like you already knew it
Yeah, you keep saying you the truth when, nigga, you gon' have to prove it

'Cause it's been a minute since I trusted somebody
'Cause I don't ever put my trust in nobody
I hate to picture you out fuckin' somebody
So I don't ever put my trust in nobody

Who am I to deny?
Yeah, you say who am I to run and hide?

Don't be jealous, put some trust inside your text when you be textin'
Tell the truth when you get tired of me askin' all them questions
I pray to God for peace and love, I'm lookin' at you as a blessing
You told me life ain't luck and love, so take that passion as a lesson

'Cause it's been a minute since I trusted somebody
'Cause I don't ever put my trust in nobody
I hate to picture you out fuckin' somebody
So I don't ever put my trust in nobody

But who am I to deny?
Yeah, you say who am I to run and hide?

I drove for miles just to find you and find myself
Only screams all these voices in my head
You gave me strength gave me hope for a lifetime
I never was satisfied

This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up

Giving up (giving up)
Giving up (giving up)
Giving up

It's not your fault
I'm a bitch, I'm a monster
Yes I'm a beast and I feast when I conquer
But I'm alone on my throne, all these riches
I came this way all this way just to say eh

This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up

Giving up (giving up)
Giving up (giving up)
Giving up

I'm giving up baby yes I'm giving up baby
It seems like I've been driving for miles
Yes I'm giving up baby
And I can't seem to silent these voices in my head
This time won't you save me?
Come save me
This time won't you save me?
Come save me

This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me?
Baby I can feel myself giving up giving up
This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me?
Baby I can feel myself giving up, giving up

This time won't you save me, this time won't you save me?
Baby I can feel myself giving up giving up

How y'all wifing these thots? You don't get wins for that
I'm having another good year, we don't get blimps for that
Pussy game still cold, we don't get minks for that
When I'm poppin' them bananas, we don't link chimps for that
I gave these bitches two years, now your time's up
Bless her heart, she throwing shots but every line sucks

Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, caught cagin' doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

Are you alone?
Do you need someone? Is it too late to talk?
Did I wait too long?
Thousand words
Don't change a thing
Is it only three?
Three words that you're missing?

Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know

Hoo, hoo
We're 'bout to play here
We're 'bout to play here
Hoo, hoo
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game

I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game

Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no easy cash, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it

How come you never show it?
All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and be loved
(To love and to be loved)

I'm losin' a thing
I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone
'Cause the tears don't end

Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know

Hoo, hoo
We're 'bout to play here
We're 'bout to play here
Hoo, hoo
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game

I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game

Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo

Yo, ayo tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted
Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it
Roll that spaceship, we about to get lifted
Lift and the President gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for

So when them big boys want all of that
Tell the bartender, say my order back
It's bottle service, he ordered that
Might let him take it home and slaughter that
He got friends for all of my friends
They ain't leaving 'till we say when
And we gon' hangover the next day
But we will remember this day
So drop the pop and get low
Or we can drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
My only motto in my life is don't lose

I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's okay, we'll take our time

The night is still young

Uh, thinkin' out loud
I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm 'bout is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and their mood change
Like a motherfucker
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you are undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters f*ck each other
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it

Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now uh?
do you hear me?
I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me
I ain't never need a man, to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, 'cause I meant it

Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank checkin' my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here?
Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend
that I eat it in the morning
'Cause she gonna say "I know"
Can I hit it in the bathroom?
Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
what's his name? Not important
I bought some cocaine, you can snort it
She became a vacuum
put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off like chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless and flawless
Smallest regardless, largest in charge
and born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly, Drake, Tunechi and Barbie you know

I-I-I-I thought I knew you

I ain't trying for a second time for real
Honestly I think this shit excites you
All that drama that you're tied to (oh yeah)
You play the victim every time too
That shit came back and hit you times two
